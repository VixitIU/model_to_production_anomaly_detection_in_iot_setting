# 🏭 Factory Anomaly Detection System

An end-to-end machine learning system for real-time anomaly detection on factory sensor data (temperature, humidity, sound).  
This project includes:  
- Data analysis & model development (Jupyter Notebooks)
- Model packaging
- REST API deployment using Flask + AWS Elastic Beanstalk

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python 3.12
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy
- Flask
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Docker

## 📊 Problem Description

In modern factories producing wind turbine components, early detection of abnormal sensor readings can prevent costly breakdowns and defective products.

This system monitors 3 key sensors:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Sound Level

Using an unsupervised machine learning model, the system detects anomalies in real-time based on incoming sensor data.
